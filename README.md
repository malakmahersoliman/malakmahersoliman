# Malak Maher

Final-year Computer Science student — AAST Smart Village  
Dual Degree with the University of Northampton  
GPA: 3.57 / 4.0  

I enjoy writing code and understanding systems deeply.

My work spans mobile engineering, applied machine learning,
and automation-driven problem solving — with a strong interest
in fintech and intelligent system design.

I do not treat development as syntax — I treat it as architecture.
