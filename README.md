# Malak Maher ✨

Final-year Computer Science Student — AAST Smart Village  
Dual Degree with the University of Northampton  
GPA: 3.57 / 4.0  

I genuinely love writing code ⚡️  

Not just to make things work —  
but to understand how systems think, scale, and evolve.

I am passionate about building real applications,  
studying machine learning deeply,  
and exploring automation that makes software smarter 💫  

For me, coding is not an assignment.  
It’s a craft 😌

## What Drives Me 🦦

• Clean, structured architecture  
• Breaking down complex systems and rebuilding them better  
• Applying machine learning to real-world problems  
• Automating processes instead of repeating them  
• Writing maintainable, scalable, intentional code  

I learn by building.  
I improve by shipping. ⚡️
